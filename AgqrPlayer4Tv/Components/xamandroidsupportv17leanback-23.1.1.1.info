{"Name":"Android Support Library V17 Leanback","Id":2602,"Alias":"xamandroidsupportv17leanback","Description":"# v17 Leanback Android Support Library\n\nThis library provides APIs to support building user interfaces on TV devices. It provides a number of important widgets for TV apps. \n\n\n\n\n## Android Support Libraries\n\nThe Android Support Libraries are a set of code libraries that provide backward-compatible versions of Android framework APIs as well as features that are only available through the library APIs. Each Support Library is backward-compatible to a specific Android API level. This design means that your applications can use the libraries\u0027 features and still be compatible with devices running older versions of Android.\n\nIncluding the Support Libraries in your Android project is considered a best practice for application developers, depending on the range of platform versions your app is targeting and the APIs that it uses. Using the features the libraries provide can help you improve the look of your application, increase performance and broaden the reach of your application to more users. \n\n\n\n","Version":"23.1.1.1","Summary":"Provide backward-compatible versions of Android framework APIs.","QuickStart":"Android offers a rich user experience that\u0027s optimized for apps running on large screen devices, such as high-definition televisions. Apps on TV offer new opportunities to delight your users from the comfort of their couch.\n\nTV apps use the same structure as those for phones and tablets. This approach means you can create new TV apps based on what you already know about building apps for Android, or extend your existing apps to also run on TV devices. However, the user interaction model for TV is substantially different from phone and tablet devices. In order to make your app successful on TV devices, you must design new layouts that can be easily understood from 10 feet away, and provide navigation that works with just a directional pad and a select button.\n\nThis component includes bindings for the v17 Android Support Leanback library.  \n\nTo learn more about building apps for Android TV, visit the [Official Android TV documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/tv/index.html).\n","Hash":"fef33963def490119a6f0c40ad4fa644","TargetPlatforms":["android"],"TrialHash":null}
